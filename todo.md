## main todo:
- [x] set up react-flow with zustand store
- [x] build solar model from data in zustand store
- [x] create forms for react-flow nodes
- [x] refactor components so planet position does not need to be in store
- [x] stars floating outside the solar system
- [ ] fix moon orbit (rotation is faster when closer to sun - probably a math error somewhere)

### etc:
- [ ] move moon button to individual planets
- [ ] simple noise textures for planets/sun
- [ ] ability to set camera to follow planets/moons
- [ ] lower the rerender rate to 30fps
- [ ] make text (header/footer) not selectable when clicking in node editor / 3d space
