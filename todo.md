## todo (ordered by priority):
- [x] set up react-flow with zustand store
- [x] build solar model from data in zustand store
- [x] create forms for react-flow nodes
- [x] refactor components so planet position does not need to be in store
- [ ] if possible, lower the rerender rate to 30fps
- [ ] fix moon orbit (rotation is faster when closer to sun - probably a math error)
