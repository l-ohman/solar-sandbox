## main:

- [x] set up react-flow with zustand store
- [x] build solar model from data in zustand store
- [x] create forms for react-flow nodes
- [x] refactor components so planet position does not need to be in store
- [x] stars floating outside the solar system
- [ ] setup mobile view (horizontal division, scaling, zooming, etc)
- [x] fix moon orbit (rotation is faster when closer to sun - probably a math/update error somewhere)
- [x] 'add planet' connects planet to sun automatically
- [x] move 'add moon' button to individual planets
- [x] tutorial / guidance for first-time users

### secondary:

- [ ] delete button on planet/moon forms
- [ ] ability to rename planets
- [ ] simple noise textures for planets/sun
- [ ] planet rings
- [ ] hide orbit rings button (also rings for moons, maybe)
<!-- - [x] lower the rerender rate to 30fps -->
- [ ] increase size of nodes/edges; improve selectability
- [ ] ability to share systems via a link (code for end of URL)
<!-- - [ ] restrict camera from leaving the system (maybe don't allow right-click movement?) -->
<!-- - [ ] switch to React production build on deployed version -->

### etc:

- [x] make text (header/footer) not selectable when clicking in node editor / 3d space
- [ ] attempt implementation of tone.js
- [ ] smoother camera movement
- [ ] realistic lighting for planets (?)
<!-- - [ ] slightly elliptical orbits -->
- [ ] improve tutorial
