## main todo:
- [x] set up react-flow with zustand store
- [x] build solar model from data in zustand store
- [x] create forms for react-flow nodes
- [x] refactor components so planet position does not need to be in store
- [x] stars floating outside the solar system
- [ ] setup mobile view (horizontal division, scaling, etc)
- [ ] fix moon orbit (rotation is faster when closer to sun - probably a math/update error somewhere)
- [ ] 'add planet' connects planet to sun automatically
- [ ] move 'add moon' button to individual planets

### secondary todo:
- [ ] simple noise textures for planets/sun
- [ ] ability to set camera to follow planets
- [x] ~~lower the rerender rate to 30fps~~
- [ ] attempt implementation of tone.js
- [ ] increase size of nodes/edges; improve selectability

### etc:
- [x] make text (header/footer) not selectable when clicking in node editor / 3d space
