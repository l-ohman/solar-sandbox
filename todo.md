## todo (ordered by priority):
[x] set up react-flow with zustand store
[ ] build solar model from data in zustand store
[ ] create forms for react-flow nodes
[ ] refactor components so planet position does not need to be in store
[ ] if possible, lower the rerender rate to 30fps
[ ] fix moon orbit (rotation is faster when closer to sun - probably a math error)
